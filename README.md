## Introduction

Over the years, AI has become more and more powerful. AI's new capabilities allow website developers to code more efficiently and effectively than ever before. It is a great tool that, if used correctly, can help aid in prototypes of projects and help put the finishing touches on an HTML website. With this article, you will learn how to use AI effectively to improve your HTML projects.

## Disclaimer

When using AI as an assistant for coding, it is important to use it in the appropriate circumstances. We want to make clear that we do not support using AI to do all of the coding. This is a bad practice as you will not learn from the coding process. AI does not think like humans and will arrange the code in a way that may not be optimal for any experienced developer. On top of that, having AI do all the work for you would be considered teaching. Work with your teacher and figure out the best way to use AI for your project. Here are some Do's and Don't's when using AI coding assistance.

| Do's | Don't's |
|------|---------|
| Ask AI for help when you are stuck on something | Have the AI write all of the code for you |
| Ask AI how it fixed an issue with your code | Have the AI write all of the text within your website |
| Use AI to prototype or test an idea before committing to a project | Assume AI did wrote all the code correctly |
| Test out any code written by the AI | Let AI organize all of the code itself |
| Ask AI any questions you may have | Let the AI have complete creative control over your project |

## Instructions

Now that we've gone over the Do's and Don't's of AI coding assistance, we'll go through the step-by-step of using AI assistance effectively in a project. Follow the steps below to take control of your project while letting AI help when you need it.

### Step 1: Start with an idea

From every great project comes a great idea. Brainstorm what you want out of your website, the way it looks, the contents of it, everything that you can think of.

### Step 2: Drafting the text

Chances are you're making a website that contains written information in it. Now that you have an idea, start writing out your text on a document. Have a teacher or parent look it over to see what might need changes and apply them. Since this website is about the information, make sure you make adjustments to it now. It will be easier to edit and correct the text now than when it is written in the code.

### Step 3: Writing the code

Now that you have your text written, it's time to start writing the code for the website. Start with the basics and once you get to the text, you can copy and paste it into the code itself. Make sure you follow good coding practices to make sure your code is readable and understandable to yourself and others. Every good website has code that is well organized and arranged!

### Step 4: Before you use AI

You should have quite a large amount of code written at this point in your project. It may be tempting now to use AI to help you with the rest, but there's another skill you can use before using the AI: Google search. Using Google search, there is a wealth of information at your fingertips, including information on HTML coding. If there is something that you would like to add to your website that you don't know how to it, Google it! For example, maybe you want the background of your website about galaxies in space to have a background of stars in space. Google it and try to find sources that will help you write this code on your own! There are plenty of great resources like Code.org and W3Schools that can help you achieve your website goals before resorting to using the AI. Sure, it is more work, but you will learn more through a Google search than you will having AI do all of the work for you. Try your best to figure it out on your own before you use AI.
