## Instructions

### Step 1

To start building your website, you need to give the generative AI a prompt for whatever you intend to make. Use simple language, but also be descriptive about what you want. If you aren't clear with the AI what exactly you are looking for, it will make assumptions. If you are just trying to get an idea, you can have a continuing conversation with the AI to further tune and tweak your website. Below are a good example prompt and a bad example prompt given to AI:
