## Introduction

Coding is a powerful resource and can give light to many different ideas. However, it can be daunting to start when you don't know much about it. With this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to use AI vibe coding to get you started on your coding journey. Whether you're a coding beginner or seasoned coding veteran, learning to use AI vibe coding can help bring your projects to life.

## What Program Should I Use?

Before we get started, it's important to use the appropriate tool for what you are trying to make depending on your coding abilities. The following are great examples to start with if you are just beginning your AI vibe coding journey:

## Instructions

Ready to get started building your website using AI vibe coding? Follow the instructions below to start making your dream website a reality!

### Step 1: The Idea

Every website starts from a simple idea. The very first thing you should do is think about what you want your website to be. Brainstorm and write out different ideas, draw what you want it to look like, let your imagination roam free. The internet is your canvas! If it's for a school project, think about the different aspects that need to be included in the assignment.

### Step 2: Prompting the AI

Once you have your idea, it's time to turn it into a reality. Give the AI a prompt that describes the website you want to create. Be specific about what you are looking for. If you type something like "create for me a website about monkeys," the AI will take many creative liberties about how to build the website. Instead, try writing something like: "Create an informational website about monkeys. Include pictures of monkeys in different habitats around the world and where monkeys are located around the world." You can give the AI a large prompt, but don't make it too big at first! You can always make adjustments later.

Below are some examples of the Do's and Don'ts of AI vibe coding prompts. Remember, there are no mistakes, only happy accidents. The AI may even surprise you!

### Step 3: Prototyping and Making Adjustments to Your Website

Once you give the AI your prompt, it will start developing your website live. You can watch as your website slowly comes to life. During this time, you may find that some things in the website are different than what you wanted. If this is the case, you can continue to talk with your AI companion and adjust the site. For example, you could tell the AI "create a table of contents that scrolls with my website", or "make the background image of the website a cute cartoon picture of monkeys."

### Step 4: Manual Adjustments

While vibe coding with AI is great, it isn't necessarily going to make everything perfect, but that's where you can swoop in and help! Even with all the text the AI will write, you can actually change it yourself! In the HTML file, look for the "<p>" and "</p>" symbols within the text. Any text that is written in there can be manually changed. You can copy and paste text from another document or free write in the file itself to change what is written on the website. This way, you can add a personal touch to the website.

### Step 5: Learning HTML Code

Once everything is put together, it's time to look through the code itself. If you want to learn HTML, you need to understand how the code works. Go through the code of your website and take notes on how it works. You can even manually copy the code into another file to practice HTML coding. You can also play with the code itself. Try adjusting different things in the code to see how it changes your website. The fun of building your very own website is, well, making it your own! Add your own personal flourishes to it. And if what you want is to complex, you can either ask your AI companion for help or search on Google to figure out how to do it.

## Example Projects

With the power of AI vibe coding on your side, the website possibilities are endless! Below are just a few examples of the different kinds of projects you can make using the power of AI vibe coding:
